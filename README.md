# ALG_Assignment
This project addresses a task allocation problem with tasks defined by time and profit. Two solutions are presented: a Dynamic Programming approach for optimal profit and a Greedy Algorithm for an efficient, approximate solution using profit-to-time ratios to select tasks within available hours. for a few seconds

Use Case: Allocating Tasks to Workers
Problem Description:
You are a manager and need to assign tasks to workers in a way that maximizes productivity. Each task has:
•	A time requirement (how many hours it takes to complete).
•	A profit value (how much revenue or benefit it generates).
Each worker has a limited number of hours they can work. Your goal is to assign tasks to workers such that:
1.	The total time assigned to each worker does not exceed their available hours.
2.	The total profit is maximized.
How It Relates to the Knapsack Problem:
•	Items: Tasks.
•	Weights: Time required for each task.
•	Values: Profit generated by each task.
•	Knapsack Capacity: Worker’s available hours.
________________________________________
Example
Input:
•	Worker’s available hours: 8 hours.
•	Tasks available:
o	Task 1: 2 hours, profit = $100.
o	Task 2: 3 hours, profit = $150.
o	Task 3: 4 hours, profit = $200.
o	Task 4: 1 hour, profit = $50.
o	Task 5: 5 hours, profit = $250.
Objective:
Assign tasks to the worker to maximize total profit without exceeding 8 hours.
